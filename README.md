# swing_clustering_classification_analysis

Purpose of Study: Attempt to predict future club comparison results by classifying certain swing types and how they may react to certain mass properties

1. Cluster all swings into optimal number of groups (end result: 5)
- Heirarchical Clustering Ward method

2. Identify optimal variables in swing to identify each cluster
- Decision Tree Regression

3. Evaluate Accuracy of Model and continue study following analysis
- 75% Accuracy
